Our goal is to generate multi-view perspective RGB from text prompts given BEV semantics. To this end, we introduce a two-stage method MVPbev to first project BEV semantics to perspective views and then perform image generation w.r.t. both text prompts and individual perspective semantics. Specifically, we propose a novel initialization and denoising processes to explicitly enforce local consistency at overlapping FOVs. Results showcase the superiority of MVPbev under various metrics and test-time generalizability.
